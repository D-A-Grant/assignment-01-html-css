      <p> Ramesses II was a prominant ruler of Ancient Egypt. Ramesses II came into power at sometime around 1279. He was known as the 'Keeper of Harmony and Balance, Strong in Right, Elect of Ra'(Mark).<br  /> <br  /> <!-- This is the main body of the project and is where all of the information about Ramesses II will be presented-->

        Ramesses' legacy mostly resides in his building and construction feats. He commissioned the construction of an extravigant city. He is also well known for his conquoring of the region around Egypt. The period of his rule has been considered a peaking point in Ancient Egyptian society. Along with the creation of a great city he also commissioned the creation of a great number of temples that had never been done before by any other Pharoh. According to Encylopedia Britannica historians know almost nothing about the personal life of the King, everything known about the king is about his feats of construction and military conquest. The death of Ramesses II brought in the begining of the end for the Egyptian Empire, forcing the Egyptians to focus more on the home front and less on military campiagns of conquest.<br /><br />

         Encylopedia Britannica states that Ramesses II had the second longest rule in Egyptian history, he ruled for 66 years. He is most well known for the poem written by Percy Bysshe Shelly titled "Ozymandias".</p>

<section class="poem"> <!-- added a section about the poem Ozymandias -->
  <p><b>Ozymandias</b><br  />I met a traveller from an antique land,<br  />
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br  />
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br  />
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br  />
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br  />
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br  />
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br  />
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br  />
And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br  />
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br  />
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br  />
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br  />
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br  />
    The lone and level sands stretch far away.”<br  />
  -Percy Bysshe Shelly</P>
